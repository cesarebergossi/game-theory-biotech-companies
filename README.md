The repository features a PDF document delving into the profound intersections of Artificial Intelligence and drug discovery in the rapidly evolving landscape of pharmaceutical innovation, analysing strategic dynamics between biotech firms and AI-oriented organizations. This research project was undertaken as part of the course 'Applications of Game Theory to Business' during my exchange at City University of Hong Kong in my third year of BSc. \

In this study, we unravel the intricate web of AI-driven collaborations within the biotechnology sector, where companies navigate a delicate balance between cooperation and self-interest. The research examines the strategic interactions between companies under the lens of game theory, aiming to unveil how these collaborations influence medical innovation and optimize resource allocation. By examining the trade-off between cooperation and competition in this dynamic industry, this project reveals the incentives that either drive these kinds of alliances or induce firms to pursue their own R&D path to optimize resource allocation.
